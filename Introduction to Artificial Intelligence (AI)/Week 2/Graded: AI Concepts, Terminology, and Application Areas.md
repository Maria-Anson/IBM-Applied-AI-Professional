      Takes data and rules as input and uses these inputs to develop an algorithm that will give us an answer

> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> This statement is not an attribute of either Machine Learning or Unsupervised Learning. Machine Learning techniques such as unsupervised learning are not fed rules. Rather they determine the rules from data.

> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Deep Learning algorithms rely on several layers of processing units, or neurons, where each layer passes on its output to the next layer, which processes it and passes it onto the next. The number of layers and the types of functions that connect the outputs of each layer to the inputs of the next are configured by developers.
