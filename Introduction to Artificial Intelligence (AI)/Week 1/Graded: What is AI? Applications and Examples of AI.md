> 
> Which of the following is NOT a good way to define AI?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 
>  AI is the application of computing to solve problems in an intelligent way using algorithms. 
> 

      AI is all about machines replacing human intelligence. 
> 
>  AI is the use of algorithms that enable computers to find patterns without humans having to hard code them manually 
> 
>  AI is Augmented Intelligence and is not intended to replace human intelligence rather extend human capabilities 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> While AI can involve simulation or imitation of intelligent human behavior, it is not solely about machines having human intelligence. It also involves machines augmenting human intelligence by extending human capabilities.
> 
>  2.Question 2
> 
> Which of the following is an attribute of Strong or Generalized AI?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      Perform independent tasks 
> 
>  Operate with human-level consciousness 
> 
>  Can perform specific tasks, but cannot learn new ones 
> 
>  Cannot teach itself new strategies 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Strong or Generalized AI can perform independent tasks and teach itself new strategies to solve new problems.
> 
>  3.Question 3
> 
> AI is the fusion of many fields of study. Which of these fields, along with Computer Science, plays a role in the application of AI?
> 
> 1 / 1 point

      All responses are correct 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> AI is the fusion of all of these fields of study, and more. While Philosophy provides guidance on intelligence and ethical considerations in the application of AI, Mathematics and Statistics help determine viable learning models and measure performance.

>  Collaborative Robots helping humans lift heavy containers 
> 

      Making precise patient diagnosis and prescribing independent treatment 
> 
>  Self-Driving vehicles utilizing Computer Vision to navigate around objects 
> 
>  Classifying rock samples to identify best places to drill for oil 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> In Healthcare, while AI is being used to support doctors arrive at more accurate preliminary diagnoses, it is not yet being used to replace one-on-one interactions between doctors and patients.
> 
>  5.Question 5
> 
> Natural Language AI algorithms that learn by example are the reason we can talk to machines and they can talk back to us.

      True 
> 
>  False 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> The Natural Language Processing and Natural Language Generation capabilities of AI make it possible for machines and humans to interact with each other using natural language. Examples of this include Watson, Alexa, Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant.
> 
>  6.Question 6
> 
> Advances in the field of Computer Vision make which of the following possible?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      Detecting cancerous moles in skin images 
> 
>  Detecting fraudulent transactions 
> 
>  On-demand online tutors 
> 
>  Real-time transcription 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Computer vision algorithms are helping doctors arrive at more accurate preliminary diagnoses. AI-powered advancements in this technology make it possible to find symptoms in X-Ray and MRI scans and even detect cancerous moles in skin images.
> 
>  7.Question 7
> 
> Which of these is currently NOT an application of Collaborative Robots or Cobots?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      Personal use in the home such as doing the laundry and cooking for example 
> 
>  Robots assisting or replacing humans in jobs that may be dull, dangerous, ineffective or inefficient when done by humans 
> 
>  Robots helping humans lift heavy containers 
> 
>  Robots helping move items on shelves for stocking purposes 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> Collaborative robots being used in homes to support us in our personal tasks such doing laundry independently is certainly a future possibility but not yet a reality.

>  8.Question 8
> 
> Which of the following aspects involved in converting the stethoscope into a digital device to support patient diagnoses involves the use of AI?
> 
> 1 / 1 point 
> 

      An app on the mobile device that applies learnings from previous diagnosis data to assist the physicians in their current diagnoses 
> 
>  Inserting a digitizer into the stethoscope tube to convert the analog sound of the heart beat into a digital signal 
> 
>  Sending digital signals to a mobile device with a machine learning app via bluetooth 
> 
>  Graphing heart beat data on the mobile device allowing a physician to spot trends 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
> 
> The app that uses machine learning algorithms trained on previous diagnosis data to suggest diagnosis and assist the physician in their findings is very much an application of AI.
