>  Data and insights belong to the people and businesses who created them. Organizations that collect, store, manage, or process data have an obligation to handle it responsibly.

>  Knowing how an AI system arrives at an outcome is key to trust. To improve transparency, we should define how we build, deploy, and manage AI systems through scientific research. 
> 
>  Unbiased models and a spirit of diversity and inclusion are necessary to create fair AI systems, which can mitigate, rather than magnify, our existing prejudices.

> 
> Check
> 
> Correct

>  6.Question 6
> 
> Ethical concerns with AI systems are:
> 
> 1 / 1 point

      Something that should be the concern of every AI developer, so they can be mitigated for as AI systems are developed. 
> 
>  Short term and easily addressed when developing new AI systems.

>  Something that can’t be mitigated for. 
> 
> Check
> 
> Correct
>

> 
> **B.** Loss of jobs due to AI replacing workers performing repetitive tasks.
> 
> **C.** Concern about the trustworthiness of decision-making supported by AI systems.
